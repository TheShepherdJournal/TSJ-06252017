## Local travel baseball team Oil City Stags to complete in 13U/14U World Series

In July, the travel baseball team Oil City Stags will be competing in the 13U/14U World Series which will take place in Struthers, Ohio. OC Stags player and Shepherd Middle School student Konnor Moore shared some thoughts about the upcoming competition:

>I am excited to play in the 13U/14U World Series in Ohio next month. My team and I have worked so hard this season. I'm excited for a few things. I'm excited to play with my teammates and show everyone that we are the best. And I'm excited to play my best games for my grandma because she won't be able to come and watch me play. My team has worked so hard and we have great coaches who keep pushing us to be better every game we play. I know that I'll never be an actual MLB player but I want to work in baseball when I graduate college. I love the game and the history of the game. Thank you to my community for their support of baseball and the ones who helped me be the player I am. GO STAGS!

Best of luck to Konnor and the Oil City Stags.
