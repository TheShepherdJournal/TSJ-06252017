**Q: Does the requirement for motorcycle Temporary Instruction Permits (TIP) which says "you must be under the constant visual supervision of a licensed motorcycle operator who is at least 18 years old at all times" mean that the supervisor must be on a motorcycle or is it acceptable for him/her to be in a car?**

 With a TIP you are not allowed to have any passengers on the bike with you. It means you must have a licensed rider riding their bike next to you and must be within constant visual contact. This is very similar to a Graduated Driver's License for a motor vehicle. This allows a new rider to gain experience under the watchful eye of licensed and experienced rider.

To obtain your TIP permit, follow the steps below:

1. Visit a Secretary of State branch office to take the [vision](http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1627_8669_9040_9043-272086--,00.html) and [written knowledge test](http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1627_46351_46352-167446--,00.html) and obtain a [Temporary Instruction Permit (TIP)](http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1627_46351_46352-167437--,00.html). The cost for the TIP is $13.50.

2. Practice riding up to 180 days with endorsed motorcyclist.

3. [Schedule and pass rider skills test](http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1627_46351_46426-167444--,00.html).

4. Take skills test certificate to branch to obtain CY endorsement $9.00 (additional license fees may apply).



**Q: Are golf carts and 4 wheelers allowed to drive on the roads?**

Yes and no. There are certain requirements that must be met first. There are also certain roads that such vehicles are not allowed on, such as Wright Avenue. See the ORV ordinance posted on the village website [www.villageofshepherd.org](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.villageofshepherd.org%2F&h=ATOMJy8nC2j7GZz3bMllZ8U5stum0cL_587qVVkHYLb35IiIyRospRcwxyhVF3U2BR-ZOUgaO0hqg2p1XKm_UEUvtPSf7guVz9c67L1FQUE2s_Aj5-ZQmfL56B7bwDzcq2i2-dmg).
